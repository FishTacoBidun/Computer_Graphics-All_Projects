HOW TO RUN:
1) Go here: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/10KwaMpqurK_U5miuMwpV7SZ31zbq6ayK/view?usp=sharing" and download Sample2022.zip
2) Unzip the file contents and select the file “sample.sln”, opening it with Microsoft Visual Studio. This will take you to the file “sample.cpp”.
4) Replace the contents of the default sample.cpp with the code from a different sample.cpp in one of the project folders.
5) Add any additional files in the project folder to your Sample2022 folder (That are not the PDF files)
3) Run these commands:
	- Under “Build”: Clean Solution
	- Under “Build”: Build Sample
	- Under “Debug”: Start Without Debugging
4) This will then give you your final display.
